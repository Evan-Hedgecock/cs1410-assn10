Me: Do not give me any code to answer this problem, I just want help thinking through it.

I'm trying to write a recursive function to calculate the height of a BST. The helper function should just return 0 if the root is null, and then return the value of the recursiveHeight function.

The recursiveHeight function should iterate through each level of the tree, returning 1 whenever a new level is reached. Comparing the height of recursing right and left and just adding whichever side is greater works for an unbalanced tree, but I would have to write another conditional for if their equal and that feels too messy. I could also just count the number of nodes and perform a logarithm expression to calculate what the height should be, but I want it to be exact for the tree I'm looking at always.

I'm struggling to understand how to only increment the height when going either left or right, without knowing which side is longer. If it's a balanced tree, it could also just recurse in one direction always and count those...

Claude: Let me help you think through this step by step.
        First, let's clarify what we're trying to achieve. The height of a BST is the number of edges in the longest path from the root to any leaf node. Or in other words, it's the number of levels minus 1 (if we consider the root as level 1).
        Let's break down your thought process:

        You correctly identified that we need a base case where null returns 0
        You see that we need to somehow compare left and right subtrees
        You're concerned about handling equal heights elegantly
        You're looking for a way to count levels without explicitly checking which side is longer

        Here's the key insight that might help: Instead of thinking about "incrementing when going left or right", think about building the height from the bottom up. At each node:

        Get the height of the left subtree
        Get the height of the right subtree
        The height at the current node will be the maximum of these two values, plus 1

        Why does this work? Because:

        Each recursive call gets us the complete height of that subtree
        By taking the maximum, we automatically handle both balanced and unbalanced cases
        The "+1" accounts for the current level, regardless of which subtree was taller

        So rather than trying to increment as you go down, let the recursion build the height as it comes back up. This eliminates the need for:

        Tracking which direction you're going
        Special handling for equal heights
        Knowing about balance in advance

        Does this help clarify how to think about the problem? Would you like me to elaborate on any part?
